    <h3>Welcome to my profile. I'm Phoenix, or "h1divp"!</h3>
    I've worked on projects that deal with web, mobile, databases, and APIs. Not crazy stuff, but I've had a lot of fun. Definitely want to try out some other things too.<br>
    To give you some background, I originally taught myself how to program, but after taking university classes I enjoy regularly working with others more. I hope to write good and impactful software. I value simplicity. I love OSS.

<h6>P.S.: the banner image was the result of me messing around in GIMP for way too long. I've also never changed my pfp... lol</h6>
